# Exercise 2: _Components in Vue.js_
> In this exercise you will learn about components, parent child relationships: how to pass data from the parent to the child & how to emit events in the child to tell the parent that something has happend
>
> In the last tutorial we learnt about one-way and two-way data binding. 
> One-way data-binding is accomplished with _v-bind_. With the help of this directive the Application data can be easily mapped to an HTML element _(so luckily no traversals through the HTML DOM are necessary for finding the intended element)_
> Two-way data-binding means we additionally listen to an event that could occur and change our application data _(e.g. an input event on a text field)_.
> In vue this may easily accomplished with v-model
>
> Now have fun with this tutorial! üòèüñ≥
