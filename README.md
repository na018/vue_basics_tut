# Exercise 3: _Directives (conditionals, loops)_
> In this exercise you will learn about directives with focus on conditional one _(v-if)_ and loops _(v-for)_
>
> In the last tutorial you learned how to pass data from a parent to a child component. In this tutorial you will reuse the child component in another component to understand the benefits of reusable components.
>
> Additionally you will emit an event from a child component _(this.$emit('functionCalledInParent'))_ to inform the parent component something has happened. _(Here a user has clicked on a card)_.
>
> Now have fun with this tutorial! üòèüñ≥ 

## Setup: Keep up & running

``` bash
# download branch (make sure you are one level above vueTut)
git clone -b origin/exercise/02_directives https://github.com/na018/vue_basics_tut.git vueTut/02_directives && cd vueTut/02_directives

#prerequisite: node.js is installed
node -v                                      #returns for example v8.2.1

# install dependencies
npm i

#start the json mock server
node server.js

# run the application (should open a browser window automatically)
npm start

```

## ToDo
In src/components/userAdminComponents/ActivateUser.vue:
1. |KB-3| use 'src/components/userAdminComponents/UserCard.vue' `<m-user-card>` for displaying the user nicely _(reuse the component built in the previous tutorial)_
2. |KB-4| implement the method `setActive()`, which is activated when a user click on the btn. This method should tell the parent component to update it's activeUser

in src/components/pages/UserAdmin.vue:

3. |KB-3| define `activeUser:{}` Object and `allUsers: {}` Object & delete onePerson*
4. |KB-3| loop over `allUsers` and display them in `<m-activate-user>` component
5. |KB-4| `<m-activate-user>` emits the event `changeActiveUser()` the activeUser should be updated, but only if it is not already the active User
