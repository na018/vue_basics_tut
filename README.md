### Intro
This Project is part of the study subject _Webapplication Development (with focus on web frameworks)_ at the [_Stuttgart Media University_](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de) in the masters program _Computer Science and Media_ and was realized in summer semester 2018.

The frontend web application was developed with the client-side JavaScript framework [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) _(^2.5.2)_.
The backend will be realized with the GoLang Framework _Iris_.
For test occasions this tutorial is provided with a JSON mock server that will later be replaced by the GoLang backend application.
In the attached PDF a closer look on both frameworks will be provided. 
It includes:
* Framework choice
* analytical aspects
* further explanations to the exercises

The exercises are chosen wisely trying to improve the comprehension of the main concepts of the frameworks on the one side, while keeping the exercises small and clear on the other side allowing to get a quick basic understanding.
